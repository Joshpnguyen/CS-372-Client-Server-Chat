# CS-372-Client-Server-Chat

This program is a locally hosted Client-Server program that uses Python sockets to exchange messages. The program runs on the localhost IP and requests for a port number from the user.

The program is coded in Python3. Both client and server can be ran with simple execution commands (eg: ./client.py)
